# Kickstarter_analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
*Deliver outcomes based on lunch date Chart*
Use YEAR() function after converting them to Date.
separate the goal base of different ranges and analyze them as a base of successful, failed, and canceled. 
I had a hard time getting my chart the same as on the source and I was not able to do it. 
Most of the project was successful, They had better outcome during Jun and July.
check more categories to see which area was more successful . 
we mostly just work on one category.
